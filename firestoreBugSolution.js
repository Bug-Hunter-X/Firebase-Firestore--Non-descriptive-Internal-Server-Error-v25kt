To improve error handling, utilize more specific error catching and logging techniques. Consider using try...catch blocks to handle potential exceptions, and log detailed error messages including the error code, timestamp, and affected data.  Additionally, ensure your Firestore rules are correctly configured and that you are not exceeding any quota limits. For example:
```javascript
try {
  // Your Firestore write operation here
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Firestore Error:', error);
  console.error('Timestamp:', new Date());
  // Log other relevant data here
}```
This approach offers a more comprehensive logging system, providing valuable information for debugging purposes.
